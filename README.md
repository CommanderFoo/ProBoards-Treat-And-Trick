Treat and Trick WIP
===================

This plugin isn't complete.  This is a twist on Trick-or-Treat around Halloween time.

Instead of getting treats from asking, the user has to earn those treats from making posts (and possibly other ways to be added) and use them to purchase tricks from the store.  

Purchased tricks are stored in the members inventory which can then be used to trick members on the forum.

Maybe I will visit it again in the future.  I stopped developing it as I couldn't come up with good trick ideas.
